# ShortestPathGraph
We have implemented and analysed algorithms which finds out shortest path in a graph. The algorithms used are 
(i) A* search algorithm, 
(ii) Bellman- Ford algorithm 
(iii) Floyd- Warshall algorithm

The project is made for getting a better understanding of data structures and algorithms. This project is a website which allows users to test and run the program which gives shortest path in the graph entered by the user.

Follow the following steps to setup web server in your system to setup the website:
1. Open SQL and login.
2. Execute the commands written in SQLcommands.txt
3. In home.py file, replace following with your information
    (a) "root" with your username in SQL
    (b) "" with your password in SQL
4. Open terminal (in Linux) or cmd ( in windows) in the folder where you have downloaded these files.
5. Execute following command,
    python home.py
6. Hurray ! Website is ready !
7. Open "127.0.0.1:5000" in your web browser to view the website.

HAPPY CODING :)
